# featureloop
This Repository contains branches.
I tried adding 9 branches, edit everyone and see what happens.
It looks like the new branches overtake the old ones after I add the changes to them.
"feature1" - "feature8" were empty and "feature9" had all files from the previous branches.
After merging only "feature9" the master branch got all files.
